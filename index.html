Along the walls are faint patterns, etchings that pulse and shift. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Deep inside a great stone dais rises from the floor, surrounded by jagged black pillars that seem to drink the faint light emanating from a central pedestal. Upon it rests a sphere—translucent, swirling with a deep, abyssal blue. It pulses in time with the rhythmic sound, as if it were breathing. Three figures stand before the pedestal, cloaked in tattered robes. Their heads tilt at unnatural angles, as if sensing without sight.
